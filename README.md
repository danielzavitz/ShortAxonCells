# Short_Axon_Cell_Networks
This MATLAB code corresponds to the paper “Effect of Interglomerular Inhibitory Networks on Olfactory Bulb Odor Representations” by D. Zavitz,  I. A. Youngstrom, A. Borisyuk, and M. Wachowiak, published in the Journal of Neuroscience. 

Running “data_generation_shell.m” will compute glomerular odor representations of an odor panel from Burton et al. 2019 with interglomerular inhibition mediated by both “selective” and “nonselective” networks.
